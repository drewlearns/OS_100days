## OS_100Days ( NAME IS A WIP )

### How to contribute

Look for issues on github here: https://github.com/drewlearns/OS_100days/issues or join the conversation on discord for more direction.

After you find an issue on github that you'd like to work on, make a comment on it and assign it to yourself. ![https://p289.p2.n0.cdn.getcloudapp.com/items/bLu5O9Yk/0c1a0e7f-b315-42bf-a833-5c90dd34f680.jpg?v=62b7da0f94d58b6e284cb88b0fe08994](https://p289.p2.n0.cdn.getcloudapp.com/items/bLu5O9Yk/0c1a0e7f-b315-42bf-a833-5c90dd34f680.jpg?v=62b7da0f94d58b6e284cb88b0fe08994)

### Who can Contribute?

If you know html, css, or Javascript, this project is for you! EJS and express router will come in handy later.

---

### Don't know git yet? Here is a rundown on git:

`git clone git@github.com:drewlearns/OS_100days.git`
This command will allow you to clone our repo locally.

`git checkout -b "NAME_OF_YOUR_BRANCH"` Create a new branch from develop branch and do your work.

When you are done coding something for an issue. Run: `git add .` (that period means all files, you can specify a file name if you choose) this will stage all your changes for `git commit -m "YOUR_COMMIT_MESSAGE"`.

After you commit, you'll want to push your changes using `git push` - it's likely that your upstream isn't ready yet and the output of that command will tell you something like `git push --set-upstream origin NAME_OF_YOUR_BRANCH`, run that and then your changes will be visibile on https://github.com/drewlearns/OS_100days.
