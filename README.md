# OS_100days
An opensource Project from CodingWithDrew.com

## About

Ever do the [100daysofcode.com](https://100daysofcode.com) challenge and find yourself skipping, forgetting which day, etc?

Well this project aims to correct that with friendly reminders, a simple way to keep track of what day you are on, and will allow you to tweet directly from it.  (hopefully)

## Is it opensource?

Yes, though I'm still trying to figure out what all that entails. If you have opensource experience and want to join, great! We would love to have you join our community!

Join me, Drew Karriker and friends, at [https://discord.gg/AntJA73Qx2](https://discord.gg/AntJA73Qx2). Let's code!
